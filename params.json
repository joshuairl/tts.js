Look at following table, `tts.js` can easily know the support of each speaker(type of each TTS service) we use:\r\n\r\n<p name=\"js-placeholder\">browser_support_table</p>\r\n\r\n# Quick Demo\r\n<p name=\"js-placeholder\">quick_demo</p>\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n`TTSManager` is the manager `tts.js` use to handle its TTS services. It is initialized with several `Speaker` instances.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Pass one or more speakers into manager\r\nvar ttsmanager = new TTSManager([NativeSpeaker, BaiduSpeaker]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach `Speaker` instance represents each TTS service that `TTSManager` can use. `tts.js` provide several built-in TTS `Speakers`, and you can build your own `Speaker` class by just implementing a few functions and properties in order to bw operated by `TTSManager`.\r\n\r\nTill now, `tts.js` provide these `Speaker`.\r\n\r\nWhen you get a `TTSManager` instance, the only thing you need to do is call the `.speak` function:\r\n\r\n<p name=\"js-example\">example_speak</p>\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar str = $('.example-1').val();\r\nttsmanager.speak(str, function() {\r\n  console.log('speaking finish');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
